# CIFAR-10S 

We introduce `CIFAR-10S`, a dataset of soft labels elicited from individual annotators over the [`CIFAR-10`](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) test set (the same images used in [`CIFAR-10H`](https://github.com/jcpeterson/cifar-10h/blob/master/README.md)). At present, we have soft labels collected for 1000 images. Each image have been annotated by at least 6 annotators. This structure of this README is based on the form used by [Peterson et al](https://github.com/jcpeterson/cifar-10h/blob/master/README.md).
